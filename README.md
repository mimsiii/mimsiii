- 👋 Hi, I’m @mimsiii
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, nature, cats😸
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular

Problem-solver, analytical thinker, perfectionist, who desires to progress and to become an experienced Software Developer and a valuable Team Member.
I'm currently on my journey of studying Software Development.
So far I'm familiar with C++, SQL, C#, JavaScript, PHP, SSMS, MySQL, .NET Framework, HTML & CSS, Algorithms and Data Structures with C++, but I'm always adding a new skill to my repertoire.
More precisely I'm more into back end programming.
